#CS-255

This class was about creating the DriverPass project which was a project for creating an application to study for driving exams and signup for driver exams. The client for the project was DriverPass that took care of the Driving Test. The system I wanted to design was a web-based app that worked on all devices for ease of use. I believe I explained how everything would work particulary well. The part I want to revise would be the requirements as I am not sure if I did that section right and it is really important for developing a well functioning application. The users needs was to be able to study for driving courses on their own time and I believe I incorporated that properly by having a website accessed by an device and material avaiable for download incase of internet outages.
